Your one-stop-shop for quality assuring best practices and web development advice.

 A lot of the stuff that made it into this version of the Unicorn Handbook could be described as best practices and plain old good advice. It's the accumulation of knowled gathered over the years, from a freelancer to a team manager, whilst working on quick two day projects to year long undertakings. You could call it a tally of the countless things I've initially done wrong, but later learned to do better =) Take it for what it is, just a few suggestions and a nudge in the right direction!

I was inspired to create the Unicorn Handbook after reading the fantastic but modestly named <a href="https://github.com/mdo/code-guide" taget="_blank">Code Guide</a> by @mdo. I strongly recommend that you read it. Much of the HMTL/CSS advice I wholehartedly agree with and copied straight across. More of what is covered in this guide is based on the countless blog posts, guides, tweets, rants, etc. made by people infinitely more familiar with the intricate details of these technologies. I can't even start to make a list of my daily and ongoing inspiration, yet alone the sources I've used as the foundation for this handbook.
