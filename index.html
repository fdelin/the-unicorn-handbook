      <h2>Getting started...</h2>
      <p>Start by making a bed worth getting into. This means finding yourself a good editor with an automated workflow set up to make development a breeze. With the groundwork in place, the rest of your build will be much faster, much easier, and much more enjoyable.</p>

    <section id="setup-editors">
      <h3>Install a good code editor</h3>
      <p>If you're still writing code using Notepad (or heavens forbid, Dreamweaver), you're missing out. <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime</a> is awesome and very fast even on slow computers. JetBrains on the other hand makes <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/features/" target="_blank">PhpStorm</a>, a heavier but extremely competent editor, and my favourite by far. Microsoft released a new editor called <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> in April 2015, and it looks like with time it could become quite a solid software.</p>

    <section id="setup-editorconfig">
      <h3>Configure your editor</h3>
      <p>Set your editor to the following settings to avoid common code inconsistencies and dirty diffs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use soft-tabs set to two spaces</li>
        <li>Trim trailing white space on save</li>
        <li>Set encoding to UTF-8</li>
        <li>Add new line at end of files. This is mainly to stop various <a href="http://markmail.org/message/bkzgatmsklvljqgw" target="_blank" title="Why have new lines at end of files?">issues with file concatenation</a> in many <a href="http://evanhahn.com/newline-necessary-at-the-end-of-javascript-files/" target="_blank" title="Newlines at the end of Javascript files">different languages</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>A super easy way to ensure these things is to create an <code>.editorconfig</code> file with all the settings you wish to enforce. You then copy the file to the root of your projects and every editor with the <a href="http://editorconfig.org/#download" target="_blank">EditorConfig plugin</a> will read the file and automatically adjust its settings accordingly. <a href="http://editorconfig.org/" target="_blank">Learn more about EditorConfig</a> and you'll probably agree it's a great idea. Here is the <a href="editorconfig.txt" target="_blank" title="editorconfig file for download">.editorconfig</a> that I like to use. Rename the file to  ".editorconfig" once downloaded including the leading punctuation. Note that files starting with . may be hidden on your computer.

    <section id="setup-sass">
      <h3>Make it handle Sass</h3>
      <p><a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other goodies that make writing CSS efficient and fun. Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it out as a normal CSS file that you can use in your web site. More on this later.</p>
      <p>And yes, there is also a thing called <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">Less</a>. If you're knowledgeable enough to have an opinion of which of these you prefer, then by all means go with what you know and prefer! For everyone else, Sass is what I prefer and highly recommend <a href="http://sass-lang.com/guide" target="_blank">for so many reasons</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows: Download and run the single-click <a href="http://www.rubyinstaller.org/">Ruby installer</a></li>
        <li>Linux: Install Ruby through the apt package manager, <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/">rbenv</a>, or <a href="http://rvm.io/">RVM</a></li>

    <section id="scss-linting">
      <h3>Write SCSS like a pro</h3>
      <p>scss-lint is a customizable tool with opinionated defaults that helps you enforce a consistent style in your SCSS. For these opinionated defaults, we've had to make calls about what we think are the "best" style conventions, even when there are often reasonable arguments for more than one possible style. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint" target="_blank">scss-link github page</a> explaining more. Should you want to customize the checks run against your code, you can do so by editing your <a href="https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint#configuration" target="_blank">scss-lint configuration file</a> to match your preferred style. You can also download <a href="fdelin-scss-lint-config.yml" target="_blank">my scss-config file</a> to get a running start.</p>

      <p>If you use Sublime for your code editing, there is a <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint" target="_blank">SCSS linting package for Sublime</a> available for the job. If you're into the JetBrains editors like me, you should have a look at this <a href="https://github.com/idok/scss-lint-plugin" target="_blank">SCSS lint plugin</a> instead.</p>

      <h3>CSS and JavaScript includes</h3>
      <p>Per HTML5 spec, typically there is no need to specify a <code>type</code> when including CSS and JavaScript files as <code>text/css</code> and <code>text/javascript</code> are their respective defaults, used if the attribute is absent.</p>
      <h4>HTML5 spec links</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-link-element" target="_blank" title="Read spec on the 'link' element">Using link</a></li>

      <p>CSS file includes should <strong>always</strong> be placed within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag of the document, beneath any <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags.</p>
      <p>JS file includes (<code>&lt;script&gt</code> tags) should be placed at the bottom of the file, just before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.</p>
      <p>There are a few exceptions, such as <a href="http://modernizr.com" target="_blank" title="Modernizr browser feature detection">Modernizr</a>, which must be added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag</p>

      <p>Classes make for great reusable components, so they come first. Ids are more specific and should be used sparingly (e.g., for in-page bookmarks), so they come second.</p>

      <h3>Boolean attributes</h3>
      <p>A boolean attribute is one that needs no declared value. XHTML required you to declare a value, but HTML5 has no such requirement.</p>
      <p>For further reading, consult the <a
        href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#boolean-attributes"

      <blockquote>
        <p>The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If you <em>must</em> include the attribute's value, and <strong>you don't need to</strong>, follow this WhatWG guideline:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or [ … ] the attribute's canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Use soft tabs with two spaces to guarantee that code renders the same in any environment.</li>
        <li>When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.</li>
        <li>Include one space before the opening brace of declaration blocks for legibility.</li>
        <li>Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.</li>
        <li>Include one space after <code>:</code> for each declaration.</li>
        <li>Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.</li>
        <li>End all declarations with a semi-colon. The last declaration's is optional, but your code is more error prone without it.
        </li>
        <li>Comma-separated property values should include a space after each comma (e.g., <code>box-shadow</code>).</li>
        <li>Don't include spaces after commas <em>within</em> <code>rgb()</code>, <code>rgba()</code>, <code>hsl()</code>, <code>hsla()</code>, or <code>rect()</code> values. This helps differentiate multiple color values (comma, no space) from multiple property values (comma with space).
        </li>
        <li>Don't prefix property values or color parameters with a leading zero (e.g., <code>.5</code> instead of <code>0.5</code> and <code>-.5px</code> instead of <code>-0.5px</code>).
        </li>
        <li>Lowercase all hex values, e.g., <code>#fff</code>. Lowercase letters are much easier to discern when scanning a document as they tend to have more unique shapes.
        </li>
        <li>Use shorthand hex values where available, e.g., <code>#f84</code> instead of <code>#ff8844</code>.</li>
        <li>Quote attribute values in selectors, e.g., <code>input[type='text']</code>. <a href="http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/unquoted-attribute-values#css" target="_blank" title="Read article on input selectors in JS/CSS">They're only optional in some cases</a>, and it’s a good practice for consistency.

        <li>Although <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css2/syndata.html#uri" target="_blank" title="Read about quotes on url values">they're optional</a>, always use quotes around <code>url()</code> values, to limit the risk of broken URLs (e.g., <code>background-image: url('image.png')</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Always use single ' ' quotes instead of double " " quotes (technically it does not matter, but keep it consistent. Besides, it's how Google and many other large companies prefer their code formatted).</li>
        <li>Avoid specifying units for zero values, e.g., <code>margin: 0;</code> instead of <code>margin: 0px;</code>.

      <p>Related property declarations should be grouped together following the order:</p>

      <p>Positioning comes first because it can remove an element from the normal flow of the document and override box model related styles. The box model comes next as it dictates a component's dimensions and placement.</p>
      <p>Everything else takes place <em>inside</em> the component or without impacting the previous two sections, and thus they come last.</p>
      <p>When writing SCSS, always start with your <code>@extend</code> declarations, followed by your properties and finally the rule sets. I'm actually slowly changing my mind about the order and sometimes find myself preferring to simply sort my declarations alphabetically.</p>

      <p>By grouping your style in this way, adding a few extra breakpoints won't take any time at all, but it might make all the difference to the appearance of the page.

        <li><code>padding</code></li>
        <li><code>margin</code></li>
        <li><code>font</code></li>

        <li><code>border</code></li>
        <li><code>border-radius</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Often times we don't need to set all the values a shorthand property represents. For example, HTML headings only set top and bottom margin, so when necessary, only override those two values. Excessive use of shorthand properties often leads to sloppier code with unnecessary overrides and unintended side effects.</p>

      <p>Avoid creating complex selectors. With Sass, unnecessary nesting is one of the easiest ways to over qualify your selectors. Just because you can nest, doesn't mean you always should. Consider nesting only if you must scope styles to a parent and if there are multiple elements to be nested. There is a level of convenience involved of course, but please keep the end result in mind.</p>

    <section id="css-comments">
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <p>Code is written and maintained by people. Ensure your code is descriptive, well commented, and approachable by others. Great code comments convey context or purpose. Do not simply reiterate a component or class name.</p>
      <p>Be sure to write in complete sentences for larger comments and succinct phrases for general notes.</p>
      <p>Wrap long comments to make them easier to read:</p>

      <p>There is a discussion going on about how to technically comment your CSS. You see, CSS uses the same "block comment" syntax as the C-like languages - you start a comment with /*, and end it with */. But you can also add // in front of a line to comment it out. Now this is not a "true" comment as CSS is missing the "line comment" syntax that many other languages have. What actually happens is that you put an invalid value in your style sheet, thus nullifying whatever comes after. Keep this in mind if minifying your CSS as you might accidentally "comment out" a huge chunk of your CSS when everything gets saved on one line. Personally I really like line commenting and use // frequently. Sometimes I mix it up and use /* ... */ for larger blocks of text, but as a general rule, I try not to. In my case I use Sass and when I built it into CSS it automatically removes the comments and minifies the output as well.

    <section id="css-classes">
      <h3>Class names</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep classes lowercase and use dashes (not underscores or camelCase). Dashes serve as natural breaks in related class (e.g., <code>.btn</code> and <code>.btn-danger</code>).
        </li>
        <li>Avoid excessive and arbitrary shorthand notation. <code>.btn</code> is useful for <em>button</em>, but <code>.s</code> doesn't mean anything.
        </li>
        <li>Keep classes as short and succinct as possible.</li>
        <li>Use meaningful names; use structural or purposeful names over presentational.</li>
        <li>Prefix classes based on the closest parent or base class.</li>
        <li>Use <code>.js-*</code> classes to denote behaviour (as opposed to style), but keep these classes out of your CSS.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>It's also useful to apply many of these same rules when creating Sass variable names.</p>
<pre><code class="css">/* Bad example */

      <h3>JavaScript code quality</h3>
      <p>As with CSS and Sass, a good linting program is an invaluable time saver and quality assuring tool you simply must explore if you've not already. Any code base eventually becomes huge at some point, and simple mistakes (that would not show themselves when written) can waste hours of debugging. And this is when static code analysis tools come into play and help developers spot such problems. JavaScript linters scans your JavaScript and reports mistakes and potential bugs. The potential problem could be a syntax error, a bug due to implicit type conversion, a leaking variable or something else. <a href="http://www.jslint.com/lint.html" target="_blank">JSLint</a> is the grandfather of JavaScript linting. Later JSHint rose to the challenge as a community driven project and is probably the better choice nowadays. Have a look at the <a href="http://jshint.com/install/" target="_blank">JSHint installation page</a> to see if you can find something for your own particular setup (I'm sure you can).</p>
      <p>It seems that almost every large company have their own code style guide and they pretty much all say the same things. Here are a few to look at: <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml" target="_blank">Google JavaScript Style Guide</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style#JavaScript_practices" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer JavaScript Practices</a>, <a href="https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/" target="_blank">jQuery JavaScript Style Guide</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp" target="_blank">W3schools JavaScript Style Guide and Coding Conventions</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript" target="_blank">Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide</a> is also a great resource.</p>
      <p>One man that really knows what he is talking about when it comes to JavaScript coding is Rick Waldron. He and his buddies put together the essential reading <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js" target="_blank">Principles of Writing Consistent, Idiomatic JavaScript</a>. Although not intended as something you should follow religiously, if you do it will infinitely improve the appearance of your code. I'm dead serious.</p>

      <h3>JavaScript libraries</h3>

For general DOM manipulation, event handling, animation and much more, <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> is the undisputed king. Talking about kings, <a href="http://modernizr.com/" target="_blank">Modernizr</a> is probably one of the other most used libraries out there, providing finer control over your solution through feature detection and reporting.

    <h2 id="sourcecontrol">Distributed Version Control Systems</h2>
    <section id="sourcecontrol-overview">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Wikipedia knows it all: "Revision control, also known as version control and source control (and an aspect of software configuration management), is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information." But I beg to differ on one point, source control is not only for large websites, it's for any type of site no matter how small. Even if only two guys work on the same code, or even just yourself, source control is your friend. I won't go into what you might be doing wrong right now such as keeping all your recent code directly on the ftp. People make changes to the same files, but how do you know if a file got changed while you were doing your own edits? When you upload, how do you know if you're overwriting updates made by others? You'd have to be pretty new in the game to work like this, but I've seen it happen more often than I'd like to admit. You say "but we keep backups and save copies of the different versions whenever we change something big". Slow clap on that. Just the thought makes my skin crawl! If you're not into proper source control, now is the time to start. It will keep your code safe. You'll be able to see what files have been changed and by whom and even when. You'll be able to have several people work on the same files and then as if by magic have the individual updates combine into one. You'll be able to see the change history of files including every single time it was updated, and every single line of code that got changed. You'll even be able to step back in time for some files but not others should you wish to go back to a previous version. If you're working on a larger site, there are endless other benefits such as linking updates to logged issues, time tracking, branch management, etc. Distributed source control is of course superior compared to solutions such as Subversion in that you don't have to be connected to be able to work with it, but taking <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> as an example there are in my mind so many other things making it the superior choice. I'm not the only one that feels this way and Git is <a href="http://www.netinstructions.com/the-case-for-git/" target="_blank">rapidly becoming the de facto standard</a> when it comes to general source control.</p>

      <h3>Getting started with Git</h3>
      <p>I admit that taking your first steps in this direction can be pretty daunting for a beginner. Please don't let that discourage you. You'll thank me later and honestly it's not as difficult as it may seem at first glance. First of all you need to sign up to a service such as <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a>. When it comes to using these services, you'd probably not want to do the terminal kind of way as a beginner. If you do, check out <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/" target="_blank">The simple guide</a> by Roger Dudler. It's to the point and as he writes "No deep shit". c0deporn released a really good video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c" target="_blank">Learn Git in 20 minutes</a> which also shows you how to use Git from the terminal. You could of course make your life a bit easier by downloading a software such as <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank">SourceTree</a> or <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/" target="_blank">Tower</a> or even the GitHub apps for <a href="https://mac.github.com/" target="_blank">OS X</a> and <a href="https://windows.github.com/" target="_blank">Windows</a>. You can set all of them up to work with both GitHub and Bitbucket. I really like SourceTree myself. There is a million and one tutorials out there, but this video called <a href="" target="_blank">GitHub - a Step by Step For Beginners using SourceTree GUI</a> is pretty good.

      <h3>Learning how to use Git</h3>
      <p>What can I say... Find a friend already using Git, and ask to sit with them for a few hours to see how it's done. That's how I picked it up! If this is not an option, there is a very good Git Beginner's Guide for Dummies series by Backlogtool.com with a <a href="http://backlogtool.com/git-guide/en/intro/intro1_1.html" target="_blank">Getting started</a> module for beginners and a <a href="http://backlogtool.com/git-guide/en/stepup/stepup1_1.html" target="_blank">Working with Git</a> section for intermediate users. They also have a very comprehensive <a href="http://backlogtool.com/git-guide/en/reference/" target="_blank">topic specific help section</a>. One resource I really like the look of is the /learn/ step-by-step course for the complete beginner by Tower (the software I mentioned earlier). It's free, very polished, and includes a fantastic <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/learn/ebook/command-line/introduction" target="_blank">eBook</a>, several <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/learn/videos#episodes" target="_blank">video courses</a> and a one hour recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwdg8-thBAc" target="_blank">webinar</a>. Other than that, Google is your friend.

      <h3>The purpose of this guide</h3>
      <p>A lot of the stuff in that made it into this version of the Unicorn Handbook could be described as best practices and plain old good advice. It's the accumulation of knowled gathered over the years, from a freelancer to a team manager, whilst working on quick two day projects as well as year long undertakings. You could call it a tally of the countless things I've initially done wrong, but later learned to do better =) Take it for what it is, just a few suggestions and a nudge in the right direction!</p>
      <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
      <p>I was inspired to create the Unicorn Handbook after reading the fantastic but modestly named <a href="https://github.com/mdo/code-guide" target="_blank">Code Guide</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo" target="_blank">@mdo</a>. I strongly recommend that you read it. Much of the HMTL/CSS advice I wholehartedly agree with and copied straight across. More of what is covered in this guide is based on the countless blog posts, guides, tweets, rants, etc. made by people infinitely more familiar with the intricate details of these technologies. I can't even start to make a list of my daily and ongoing inspiration, yet alone the sources I've used as the foundation for this handbook. It's a magical world out there. <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Go explore</a>.</p>
